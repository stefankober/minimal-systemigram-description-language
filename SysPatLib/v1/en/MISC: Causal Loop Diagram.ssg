# Causal Loop: Adoption Model

Adapted from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram#Example_2

This example shows one balancing loop (B1) and one reinforcing loop (R1)
in an adoption model.

- Colors are used to distinguish loops.
- Arrows describe causal influence (not physical flow).
- Loop names appear as labels within edge text, e.g., "increases R1".

Note: Traditional causal loop diagrams use "+" and "–" for polarity.
This version uses action verbs and semantic coloring instead.
