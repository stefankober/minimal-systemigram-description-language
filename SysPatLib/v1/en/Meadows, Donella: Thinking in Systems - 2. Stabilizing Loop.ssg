# Stabilizing Loop, Balancing Feedback

Adapted from:
Meadows, Donella: Thinking in Systems. A Primer, Earthscan 2009, p. 27

For a general overview of how Meadows' Stock-Flow-Diagrams can be translated to MSDL see "Meadows, Donella: Thinking in Systems - 1. Feedback Loops.ssg" in the same folder.

In this model:
- Stocks: "stored energy in body" and "energy available for work" (marked blue)
- Control: feedback loop (marked green as "Balancing Loop")

The original valve mechanisms have been reified as process nodes.
This makes the structure more verbose than Meadowsâ€™ diagram, but also more explicit and modular.

{Stabilizing Loop - Coffee Intake}

stored energy in body (is released through) metabolic mobilization of energy.
metabolic mobilization of energy (provides) energy available for work.
energy available for work (goes to) energy expenditure.
energy available for work (is monitored by, green) energy monitor.
desired energy level (is set in, green) energy monitor.
energy monitor (on discrepancy adjusts, green) coffee intake.
coffee intake (adjusts, green) metabolic mobilization of energy.
