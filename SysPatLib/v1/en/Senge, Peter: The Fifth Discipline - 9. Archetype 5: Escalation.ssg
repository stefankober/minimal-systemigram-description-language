# Archetype 5: Escalation 

Adapted from:
Senge, Peter: The Fifth Discipline, Currency Doubleday 1990, p. 384

This archetype consists of two balancing processes that influence each other's goals.

Each actor attempts to improve their performance relative to the other. Because both are using the other's results as a benchmark, any improvement by one party prompts a counteraction by the other. The loops are balancing in nature, but the reference points adjust continuously, leading to runaway escalation. That is why these are not escalating loops.

This pattern is common in arms races, price wars, feature competitions, or status signaling. It is driven by comparison, not absolute need.
