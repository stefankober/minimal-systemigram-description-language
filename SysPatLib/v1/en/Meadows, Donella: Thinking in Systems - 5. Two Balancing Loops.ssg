# Two Balancing Loops - One Stock System

Adapted from:
Meadows, Donella: Thinking in Systems. A Primer, Earthscan 2009, p. 36

For a general overview of how Meadows' Stock-Flow-Diagrams can be translated to MSDL see "Meadows, Donella: Thinking in Systems - 1. Feedback Loops.ssg" in the same folder.

In this model:
- Stock: room temperature (marked blue)
- Control: two feedback loops with different goals (marked green as "Balancing Loop")

One original valve mechanisms have been partially reified as process nodes.
This makes the structure more verbose than Meadowsâ€™ diagram, but also more explicit and modular.

The point here is to see two goal seeking loops on the same stock that drag the overall system in two directions, and in this case, one "wins".

The original diagram is very high level, and is stated in a way that leaves open different interpretations. 

Important with these kinds of loops is that some of the behaviors introduce a delay, which causes the stock to oscillate or fall short of or overshoot target values. 

Note the adjustment that "heat (flows out of) room temperature." This difference is explained in "Meadows, Donella: Thinking in Systems - 3. Stabilizing Loop.ssg" in this folder.

room temperature (is measured by, green) thermostat.
thermostat setting (sets goal for, palegreen) thermostat.

// loop two
heat (flows out of) room temperature. 
heat (moves to) outside.
outside (sets goal for, palegreen) nature.
room temperature (is measured by, green) nature.
